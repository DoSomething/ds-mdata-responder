ds-mdata-responder
==================

The `ds-mdata-responder` powers all of DoSomething.org's text-message-driven campaigns. It interacts with the MobileCommons platform to send messages, handling MData requests and sending responses while computing conversation logic (what message should be sent to which user when).
